Level 1: Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Identification 

Data Snippet (Nmap Scan Output): 

PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 
21/tcp open ftp vsftpd 2.3.4 
22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 
80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.2.8 ((Ubuntu) DAV/2) 
3306/tcp open mysql MySQL 5.0.51a-3ubuntu5 

Based on the service versions identified above, which port represents a service with a well-known "Backdoor Command Execution" vulnerability that often provides immediate root access? 

A) Port 22 (OpenSSH) 

B) Port 80 (Apache) 

C) Port 3306 (MySQL) 

D) Port 21 (vsftpd)

Level 2: Web Log Analysis 

Data Snippet (Apache Access Log): 

10.10.14.5 - - [01/Jan/2024:10:05:22] "GET /login.php?user=admin'# HTTP/1.1" 200 4520 
10.10.14.5 - - [01/Jan/2024:10:05:25] "GET /search.php?q=<script>alert(1)</script> HTTP/1.1" 200 1205 
10.10.14.5 - - [01/Jan/2024:10:05:28] "GET /../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1" 200 1850 

Reviewing the three requests in the log above, which specific attack vector was successfully executed in the third request (timestamp 10:05:28), indicated by the response size? 

A) SQL Injection (SQLi) 

B) Local File Inclusion  

C) Reflected XSS 

D) Brute Force Attack

ShapeLevel 3: Traffic Analysis 

Data Snippet (Wireshark Capture - HTTP Header): 

 GET /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1 
Host: 192.168.1.105 
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) 
Cookie: auth_token=YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=; 
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml 

An attacker intercepts the request above using Burp Suite. Focusing on the Cookie header, what is the immediate risk visible in this data? 

A) The User-Agent suggests an outdated browser vulnerability 

B) The host IP is a private address, indicating an internal leak 

C) The auth_token is a weak 	Base64 encoding of cleartext credentials 

D) The Accept header allows for XML External Entity (XXE) injection
