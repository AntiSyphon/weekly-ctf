Part 1 - Use the Event’x’.json files 

Level 1: The "Eyes on Glass" Phase 

Story: The time is 08:26 AM. As you are enjoying your first cup of coffee, multiple alerts appear on the dashboard. A huge block of bizarre text appears in the command line of a PowerShell process that has just started. 

Question 1: The Smoking Gun Referencing Event 4, we have alerts firing on a Base64 encoded command. After decoding the string UwB0AGEAcgB0..., what does the actual payload reveal about the intent? 

    A) It downloads a malicious payload using Net.WebClient, indicating a C2 connection. 

    B) It executes a harmless Write-Output command, suggesting a test or demo. 

    C) It attempts to encrypt files in the user's directory, indicating ransomware. 

    D) It adds a hidden user to the local administrators group for persistence. 



Level 2: The "Connect the Dots" Phase 

Story: Although you have deciphered the command, you are still not convinced. To see how this process began, you zoom out. The lineage appears disorganized. 

Question 2: The Process Chain Anomaly Looking at the process chain in Events 3 and 4, Wscript.exe spawns a new PowerShell.exe instance. Why is this specific parent-child relationship (WScript -> PowerShell) considered an important anomaly? 

    A) Wscript.exe is a deprecated process that should never run on modern Windows. 

    B) The process ID of the parent Wscript.exe is higher than the child process. 

    C) It indicates a "Living off the Land" technique often used by intermediate loaders. 

    D) PowerShell cannot technically be spawned by Wscript due to architecture limitations. 



Level 3: The "Panic Check" Phase 

Story: Your heart rate spikes as you see a new process spawn immediately after the PowerShell command in Event 6. Did the malware just establish persistence? 

Question 3: The False Positive Trap Conhost.exe spawns immediately after the PowerShell activity with the flag -ForceV1. Based on the relationship between these processes, how should this event be classified? 

    A) Malicious Persistence: The -ForceV1 flag indicates a registry hack. 

    B) Suspicious Lateral Movement: Conhost.exe is likely tunneling RDP traffic. 

    C) Normal OS Behavior: Conhost.exe is automatically spawned to host the interface for command-line apps. 

    D) Privilege Escalation: Conhost.exe is running with higher system privileges than its parent. 



Level 4: The "Process Improvement" Phase 

Story: After the incident is closed, a junior analyst asks you: "If Base64 is used by hackers, why don't we just block it everywhere?" 

Question 4: The Administrative Reality Why is relying solely on the presence of Base64 encoding (-enc) insufficient for automatically blocking a process or declaring an incident malicious? 

    A) Base64 encoding is never used by legitimate software, so it is actually always safe to block. 

    B) Legitimate administrators often use encoding to avoid syntax errors with special characters. 

    C) The alert title is generated by AI and is known to be 50% inaccurate by default. 

    D) Encoded commands are automatically blocked by the Windows Kernel anyway. 

 

 

Part 2 - Use the .pcapng file 

 
Level 1: Network Indicators 

Question 1: The Malicious Infrastructure - Referencing the JNDI injection string found in the User-Agent header of the initial GET request, what is the exact IP address and port of the malicious LDAP server the victim is being instructed to contact? 


Level 2: Payload Analysis 

Question 2: The Staging Parameter - In the same User-Agent string, the attacker passes a Base64 encoded payload to the LDAP server. What is the exact name of the parameter used to hold this Base64 string? 


Level 3: Code Obfuscation 

Question 3: The Decoded Process - In the LDAP response, the attacker executes a command using JavaScript's String.fromCharCode function to bypass string-based detection. Decoding the decimal array 112,111,119,101,114..., what is the exact executable file name being launched?
