Challenge Description:

The HR team swears this environment is locked down tight. They designed it themselves and insist it is flawless, thanks to a carefully crafted blacklist that should stop anything suspicious in its tracks.

Your mission is to prove them wrong.

Explore the environment, test the assumptions, and see if a blacklist alone is enough to keep an attacker contained. If there is a way out, it is up to you to find it.

After all, nothing is truly inescapable.
