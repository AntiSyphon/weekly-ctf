Challenge Description 

A Zeek DNS sensor was deployed to improve network visibility. 
 
No alerts fired, but analysts suspect one internal system may be communicating with external infrastructure in a way consistent with command-and-control. 
 
You are provided with a single Zeek dns.log 
 
You are tasked to: 
- Identify the internal host exhibiting suspicious behavior 
- Identify the domain involved 
- Determine the approximate beacon interval 
 
The domain in question is used legitimately elsewhere in the environment, so reputation-based detection will not be sufficient 
 
Focus on behavior, not signatures 

Flag Format 

MetaCTF{<host_ip>|<domain>|<interval>} 

Flag Validation Rules 

The interval value must be a whole number between and including 20 and 30 
 
Example valid flags: 
CTF{10.47.2.100|ise.wrccdc.org|27} 
CTF{10.47.2.100|ise.wrccdc.org|26} 
CTF{10.47.2.100|ise.wrccdc.org|30}
